# 🍓 raspi-shumei

**Identity Session Framework for Raspberry Pi Automation**

Raspi-Shumei is a session persistence toolkit tailored for proxy-based identity simulation on lightweight ARM hardware (like Raspberry Pi). Built by Jayden Turner as part of the TurnerStack initiative, this project aims to mimic real-user behavior under IP rotation conditions across long sessions.

## 🔧 Project Goals

- Maintain **stable sessions** on residential/static proxies
- Deploy easily on **Raspberry Pi 4/5** as identity simulation nodes
- Provide **scriptable API** to manage sessions, rotation, and reporting
- Enable automation workflows that can mimic realistic behavioral patterns

## 📦 Repo Structure (Planned)

```
raspi-shumei/
├── core/                  # Session engine (ID, timing, cookies, etc.)
├── agents/                # Browserless and browser-based bot clients
├── configs/               # Profiles, endpoints, proxy presets
├── scripts/               # Utility and management scripts
├── docs/                  # Technical documentation
└── README.md              # You are here
```

## 💡 Use Cases

- Identity simulation for airdrop interaction
- Proxy session validation (residential SOCKS5)
- Session fingerprint experiments (headless/non-headless)
- Micro-node DePIN task scheduling

---

## 📋 Roadmap

- [ ] Modular session storage & persistence layer
- [ ] Proxy integration layer (rotation & stickiness)
- [ ] Raspberry Pi installer script (autoboot-ready)
- [ ] JSON-RPC local control API
